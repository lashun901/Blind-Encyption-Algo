    I usually code in Rust, but I'm using Python more often to:

    A - "Draft" pieces of more complex applications to get a concept down, and then refactoring & polishing in Rust.
        (This entire repository will likely be refactored in Rust)
    
    B - Become more proficient in Python. Python is widely used in industry tech-stacks, so I think it's a good idea to learn Python thoroughly.
